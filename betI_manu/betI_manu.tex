%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Introduction %% %% \section*{Introduction} Authors are
expected to provide readers with brief, high-level description of the source
organism and the rationale for its selection for sequencing. It should be
written in such a manner as to capture a reader’s attention. It should also
indicate whether or not the organism is part of a larger genomic survey project.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Abbreviations (optional) %% %% \section*{Abbreviations}
Authors should include any non-standard abbreviations that are used throughout
the article. Do not include well-known abbreviations (e.g., NCBI, EMBL, DNA,
RNA) and do not use non-standard abbreviations for organism names. Species and
subspecies names must be fully spelled out on first use as binomials (genus name
and species epithet) or trinomials (genus name, species epithet subsp.
subspecific epithet). Following first usage, the genus name may be abbreviated
by using the first letter of the genus name, followed by a period and the
epithets.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Organism Information %% %% \section*{Organism Information}

\subsection*{Classification and features} This should include succinct but
detailed description of major phenotypic features (macro- and micromorphology,
physiological characteristics), natural habitat, distribution, current
classification and phylogenetic placement of the strain/specimen selected for
sequencing. Authors should provide readers with additional background as to how
the organism was isolated from nature (if a microbe), its association with other
community members, any special properties that are noteworthy (e.g., pathogenic,
symbiotic, industrial use, taxonomic type strain, model organism, etc.). In a
separate subsection, of this section, authors should provide chemotaxonomic
information (e.g. whole cell fatty acid composition, respiratory quinones,
cell-wall composition, other unique or diagnostic cellular components).

This section should also include two figures: a phylogenetic tree indicating
current placement and a photomicrograph or electron photomicrograph of the
source organism. This section must also include a reference to Table 1, which
provides a standardized summary of key features of the source organism. The
layout of Table 1 is fixed and authors must not vary the appearance of
information in the table. Rather, they must supply this information so that
readers may view the descriptive information in a consistent fashion.

\subsubsection*{Chemotaxonomic data} Optional See the above description (under
Classification and features)

\subsubsection*{Symbiotaxonomy} Optional See the above description (under
Classification and features)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Genome sequencing information %% %% \section*{Genome
sequencing information}

\subsection*{Genome project history} This section of the manuscript should
provide a detailed summary of the sequencing, assembly and annotation
methodology.  The section should include an introductory paragraph that provides
the readers with specific information about the sequencing project, when the
project began and was completed, whether the sequence is complete or remains as
a draft genome, and the quality of the draft, which public databases contain the
project data and other relevant information. These data should be summarized in
Table 2.

A combination of Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) and 454 shotgun sequencing was
performed on the single-cell re-MDA product for actinobacterium SCGC AAA027-L06.
For Illumina sequencing, a normalized 0.3-kb shotgun library was constructed.
Briefly, 3mg MDA product was sheared in 100 ml using the Covaris E210 (Life
technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the setting of 10\% duty cycle, intensity
5, and 200 cycle per burst for 3min per sample and the fragmented DNAwas
purified using QIAquick columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The sheared DNAwas end repaired and A-tailed
accord- ing to the Illumina standard PE protocol and purified using the MinElute
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) with a final elution in 12 ml of Buffer EB. After
quantification using a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent), the fragments were
ligated to the Illumina adapters according to the Illumina stan- dard PE
protocol, followed by a purification step of the ligation product using AMPure
SPRI beads. The library was quantified using a Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity
chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and 300 ng of DNA (in 6ml) then underwent
normalization using the Duplex-Specific Nuclease (DSN) Kit (Axxora, Farmingdale,
NY, USA) (Bogdanova et al., 2009). For normalization, the dsDNA was denatured
for 3min at 981C, followed by a hybridization step at 68 1C for 5h and DSN
treatment at 68 1C for 20 min. The normalized library was amplified by PCR for
12 cycles, gel-purified and QC assessed on a Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity
Single-cell genomics of freshwater Actinobacteria SL Garcia et al chip
(Agilent), and then sequenced using an Illumina GAIIx sequencer generating 7.4Gb
(96.8M reads, 2?76 bp). For 454 pyrosequencing, a 4-kb paired-end library was
constructed and sequenced generating 79.5Mb (260 428 reads). All general aspects
of and detailed protocols for library con- struction and sequencing can be found
on the JGI website (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/). All raw Illumina sequence data was
passed through a filtering program developed at JGI, which filters out known
Illumina sequencing and library preparation artifacts. Specifically, all reads
contain- ing sequencing adapters, low complexity reads and reads containing
short tandem repeats were removed. Duplicated read pairs derived from PCR
amplification during library preparation were iden- tified and consolidated into
a single consensus read pair. The MDA introduces a tremendous bias in the
sequencing coverage of the single-cell genome. The artifact-filtered sequence
data was screened and trimmed according to the k-mers present in the data set.
High-depth k-mers, presumably derived from MDA amplification bias, cause
problems in the assembly, especially if the k-mer depth varies in several orders
of magnitude for different regions of the genome. We therefore removed reads
represent- ing high-abundance k-mers (464? k-mer coverage, k¼31) and trimmed
reads that contain unique k-mers. These filtering steps reduced the data set
from 96.8Mto 2.1Mreads with an average length of 64bp±16 bp. Assembly was
performed in several steps: (1) filtered Illumina reads were assembled using
Velvet version 1.1.02 (Zerbino and Birney, 2008). The VelvetOptimiser script
(version 2.1.7) was used with default optimization functions (n50 for k-mer
choice, total number of base pairs in large contigs for cov_cutoff
optimization). (2) The Velvet contigs were used to simulate reads from
long-insert libraries, which were used together with the filtered reads as input
for Allpaths-LG (Gnerre et al., 2011) assembly. (3) Next, Allpaths contigs
larger than 1 kb were shredded into 1-kb pieces with 200bp over- laps. (4)
Lastly, the Allpaths shreds and raw 454 pyrosequence reads were assembled using
the 454 Newbler assembler version 2.4 (Roche/454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT,
USA). This resulted in a total assembly size of 1163 583bp (75 contigs, N50: 34
337bp). The 454 data was deposited into SRA under access SRA050785. 3 Genome

\subsection*{Growth conditions and genomic DNA preparation} In the case of
cultivated organisms, please provide the source of the organism (e.g., culture
collection and accession number) and the conditions that were used to grow the
strains(s) for DNA extraction (media, temperature, aeration, volume of culture,
length of incubation). Also provide the method used to harvest and lyse the
cells, and to extract and purify the DNA and to assess its purity.

\subsection*{Genome sequencing and assembly} Provide a succinct and detailed
description of the methods used to sequence and assemble the genome(s). Identify
the sequencing center where the work was performed, the sequencing
technology(ies) used, library construction, number of reads and read length.
Cite any relevant references regarding methods used. Also, provide a succinct
and detailed description of the assembly, including the software used for
preliminary assembly, finishing and error checking and correction of
mis-assemblies.  Provide a brief description of the size of the final assembly,
the number of contigs, and coverage.

\subsection*{Genome annotation} Provide a brief and succinct description of the
methods used to identify and annotate genes, and any software used in the
annotation pipeline.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Genome Properties  %% %% \section*{Genome Properties}
Provide a summary description of the size of the genome(s) (in base pairs), the
number of chromosomes and plasmids. Include the number of predicted genes (RNA
genes, protein coding genes, pseudogenes) by number and percent of total. This
section should be linked to a chromosome map, map(s) of any plasmids and two or
three tables providing a more detailed summary of the genome properties.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Insights from the genome sequence (optional) %% %%
\section*{Insights from the genome sequence} In many cases, authors may wish to
provide a brief, yet more detailed description of major findings arising from
the genome sequence. This can be a comparison of major differences found between
the genome sequence that is the subject of the study and others (e.g., major
differences is specific metabolic pathways, significant differences in gene
content, etc.). This section is intended to permit the authors to make
preliminary observations rather than to serve as detailed comparative study. In
a short genome report, this section should be limited to two to three
paragraphs. Authors wanting to provide greater detail and to incorporate
additional genomes into their study, or to incorporate additional tables and
figures are invited to submit their articles as extended genome reports.

\subsection*{Extended insights} Authors are encouraged to provide more detailed
descriptions about insights gained from the genome sequence. This may include
comparisons of the genome to that of closely relate species, detailed
discussions about specific metabolic pathways that are noteworthy or unique, or
other features that may be of interest to the readers. Authors may include
additional tables and figures in this section (see below).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Conclusions %% %% \section*{Conclusions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Taxonomic and nomenclatural proposals (optional)  %% %%
\section*{Taxonomic and nomenclatural proposals}

Authors are free to make taxonomic proposals and revisions of existing taxa,
providing that the proposals are made in accordance with the rules of the
relevant code of nomenclature. Taxonomic proposals must include the following
sections appearing after the Conclusions section: A formal description for each
taxon - Each taxonomic proposal must have its own subsection heading, and must
appear in the proper order. Proposals for new genera must precede proposals for
new species or subspecies. New species must precede new subspecies. A proposed
name and etymology – For each new taxon proposed authors must propose a new
name, in accordance to the appropriate rules of nomenclature. The proposed name
should be followed by the etymology of the name, in grammatically correct Latin.
Authors are responsible for ensuring that proposed names meet these
requirements. A protologue – for each new taxon and name that is proposed,
authors must provide a description (also referred to as a diagnosis in botany)
that provides readers with a summarized statement of differential features that
can be used to distinguish the proposed taxon from other, closely related taxa.
The protologue should include information about the morphology, physiology,
habitat and genetics, along with any marker genes or features that can be used
for identification purposes. The protologue must conclude with a statement that
positively establishes the type strain (prokaryotes) or specimen (botany and
zoology). If a new species or subspecies of bacteria or archaea is proposed,
authors must provide the accession numbers from at least two internationally
recognized culture collections (in different countries) from which viable
samples of the type strain are available without restriction. Proposals that
fail to provide this information cannot be considered for valid publication. If
one or more new genera are proposed, the genus name(s) and description(s) must
precede those of newly proposed member species. Genus descriptions must indicate
the type species of the genus and differential/diagnostic features. In many
cases, these may be the same as that for member species. Proposals for novel
higher taxa (family and above) should appear after the species or subspecies
proposals. Emendations of existing taxa should be made in separate sections,
indicating the changes in membership and phenotypic and genotypic
characteristics on which the taxa were originally formed. Assertions of synonymy
should be presented in a separate section, with a full description of which taxa
are being combined and an assertion of which name has priority. Taxonomic
proposals of eukaryotic and virus taxa will follow the same general outline
described above, but the identification and deposition of type material differs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Authors' contributions  %% %% Might not be the right heading
level \section*{Authors' contributions} In order to give appropriate credit to
each author of a paper, the individual contributions of authors to the
manuscript should be specified in this section.

According to ICMJE guidelines(), An 'author' is generally considered to be
someone who has made substantive intellectual contributions to a published
study. To qualify as an author one should 1) have made substantial contributions
to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation
of data; 2) have been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; 3) have given final approval of
the version to be published; and 4) agree to be accountable for all aspects of
the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any
part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. Each author should
have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for
appropriate portions of the content. Acquisition of funding, collection of data,
or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify
authorship.

We suggest the following kind of format (please use initials to refer to each
author's contribution): AB carried out the molecular genetic studies,
participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript. JY carried
out the immunoassays. MT participated in the sequence alignment. ES participated
in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis. FG conceived
of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to
draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
